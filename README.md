# cloudgro

Open-source wireless soil monitoring.

----

cloudgro allows you to track your plants' soil from the cloud. First iterations will be built using a single wifi-enabled Arduino, but later versions will likely use 433/915 MHz LoRa radios sent to a single satellite- or wifi-enabled base station.
